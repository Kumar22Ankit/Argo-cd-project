### **Portfolio Deployment Project Summary**

In this project, you built and deployed a **personal portfolio** using Docker and GitHub Actions to automate the process. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what was achieved:

1. **Dockerization:**
   - The portfolio was containerized into a Docker image, making it easy to run on any system.
   - The image was tagged as `portfolio:latest` and re-tagged with your Docker Hub username for deployment.

2. **CI/CD Workflow with GitHub Actions:**
   - Automated the build and push process with a GitHub Actions workflow:
     - **Build** the Docker image.
     - **Tag** the image with your Docker Hub credentials.
     - **Push** it to your Docker Hub repository.

3. **Deployment Options:**
   - You now have the Docker image hosted on **Docker Hub** and can deploy it:
     - **Locally:** Run it with Docker on your system.
     - **Cloud (AWS/Google Cloud):** Deploy it on EC2, Cloud Run, or other platforms for public access.

4. **Access:**
   - Once the image is running (locally or on the cloud), you can access the portfolio via:
     ```
    http://localhost:8080
     ```
